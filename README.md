FileShare is a simple yet powerful solution for sharing files between your devices without the hassle of physical storage media. Whether you need to transfer files between your laptop, desktop, phone, or tablet. It also allows sharing of files across different operating systems (eg: Macos, Windows, Android).

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Local Network Security

FileShare is designed specifically for **local network use**, which provides several security advantages:

- **🏠 Network Isolation**: Files are only accessible to devices on the same local network (LAN)
- **🚫 No Cloud Storage**: Your files never leave your local network or touch external servers
- **🔒 Private by Design**: No data is sent to third parties or stored externally
- **👁️ Full Control**: You maintain complete control over your files and who can access them
- **🛡️ Network-Level Protection**: Protected by your router's firewall from external access

### Best Practices

For optimal security when using FileShare:

1. **Use on Trusted Networks**: Only run FileShare on your home or trusted private network
2. **Avoid Public WiFi**: Never use on public networks (coffee shops, airports, etc.)
3. **Firewall Protection**: Ensure your router's firewall is enabled
4. **Local Access Only**: By default, the server binds to your local network IP
5. **Temporary Use**: Run the server only when needed, shut it down when done

> **Note**: This application is intended for personal use on trusted local networks. It does not include authentication or encryption features, as it's designed to be used within the security boundary of your home network.

A: Yes! FileShare supports multiple simultaneous uploads.
